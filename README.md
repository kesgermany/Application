# QA HOME DECOR

Requirements Gathering

The purpose of this project is to create a simple online storefront, fully conforming to a provided client specification. In full commmitment to the Agile approach, User Stories were created from client specifications using Jira. There was no specific priortisation criteria for these User Stories.

Development

To build the site, I went with a front-end first approach. I believed this would be beneficial in ensuring that deadlines were met as I am a more experienced front-end developer when compared to backend. I believed that getting the front end done will first enable me work faster and also guide my backend decisions. 

Testing

Test was run using pytest but no follow up due to time constraint.

Challenges

Time Constraints: This was a major challenge as I am beginner programmer. This meant that I needed to research and learn more during the process. As a result, some pages are outstanding and will be included in future updates.

Technical Challenges: There were some technical issues with my computer causing a significant delay in the development process.

Database Connection Issues: Most likely due to the above point, there were issues with connecting to my database and database disconnections.
